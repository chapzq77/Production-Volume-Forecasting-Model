## Production Volume Forecasting Model

![](https://github.com/tshrivas/Production-Volume-Forecasting-Model/blob/master/Header.png)

**Objective:** Predict production volume for Feast, a ready-to-eat breakfast cereal brand from Bakeman Foods, based on last five years’ data on shipments, expenditure on consumer and dealer promotions, and seasonal effects on shipment of breakfast cereals, in the US. Discuss the findings in a non-technical, management memo and a detailed technical report.        

**Technologies Used:** R, Jupyter   

**Result/Key Takeaways:** We used backward stepwise regression model, using lagged values and seasonality, to forecast the production volume for Feast. Our predictive model had an accuracy of 92.85% and could explain 92% of the variations in the past months’ production volumes. Given the expenditure on consumer and dealer promotions, we predicted the production volume as January 1988 will be within the range 501189 ± 75595 units (95% CI).
